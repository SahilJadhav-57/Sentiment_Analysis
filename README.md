# Sentiment Analysis using NLP Preprocessing and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis on textual data** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing techniques** and **machine learning models** in Python.  
The goal is to classify text into sentiments (such as positive, negative, or neutral) after cleaning and transforming raw text data.

The project was developed and executed using **Google Colab**.
